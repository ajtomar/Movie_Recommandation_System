# Movie_Recommandation_System

Recommendation Systems are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on such recommandation system.

So our task will be to recommendate the best movie to an user with the help of our recommandation system. Complete datset is avilable at https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
